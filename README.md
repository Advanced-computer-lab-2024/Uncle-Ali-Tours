## Motivation

The **Trip Advising Website** was developed as part of the **Advanced Computing Laboratory (ACL)** course (Code: CSEN701) at the German University in Cairo. This project was inspired by the growing need for efficient and personalized trip planning tools in today's fast-paced world.

Travelers often face challenges in finding trustworthy information, comparing options, and making decisions that fit their preferences and budget. Our project addresses this gap by providing a user-friendly platform that offers recommendations, reviews, and detailed information to simplify the trip planning process.

From an academic perspective, this project serves as an opportunity to apply and integrate knowledge from various domains, including web development, databases, and user experience design. It also demonstrates collaborative skills and best practices in software engineering, such as version control and agile development, while solving a real-world problem.
